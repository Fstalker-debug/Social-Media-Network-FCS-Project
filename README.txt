1)  we have created a user class responsible for creating users with the relevant information. 
2) also, we set up a graph class to represent the connections between users. 
3) added a method to gaph class class just to represent my graph

by opening the python file visualizationofmygraph you can try their to visualize the graph being implemented. This implementation
uses the already created user and graph class.  The ouput will be an undirected graph where the nodes are the different users 
that has been created.
