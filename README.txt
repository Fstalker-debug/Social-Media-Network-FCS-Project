## Documentation ##
1) as we can we, as for the time being, we have created a user class responsible for creating users with the relevant information. 
2) also, we set up a graph class to represent the connections between users. 
3) added a method to gaph class class just to represent my graph

### some notes 

my graph class is capable of adding users to it and to remove them. 
my graph class represent the connections between users (Friendships) using a dictionary with lists inside of it

implemented a breadth first Search method for my graph class(BFS)

implement a depth first search method  for my graph class(DFS)

implemented a search algorith using a binary search algo to search for the ID of a user. O(log(n))

implementing a sorting algorithm for users is still not clear. I have problems switching between object instance  and it's  attributes in my function. 

the output of my function till now is not as i intended  for.
